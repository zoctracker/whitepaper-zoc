✍️ ZOC Tracker / Z-Terminal: Codifying and Standardizing Chain Hygiene 🤖
SLOGAN: Formalize the Failure. Clean the Pipe!

The ZOC Tracker is the first Analytical Data Ingestion Platform (ADIP) to codify and standardize the taxonomy required to measure Digital Debris—the massive, unquantified accumulation of obsolete code (ZOCs) on the EVM ledger.

Our mission is to establish the Chain Hygiene standard, ensuring the intellectual paternity of these critical new metrics and protocols.

🧠 Core Intellectual Property & Standardization (V1.2.2)
The conceptual core of our work is the ZOC Taxonomy (Zombie On Chain), which acts as a definitive protocol for network health. The execution of the ADIP pipeline (Technical Architecture) is designed solely to validate and maintain the rigor of this protocol.

Taxonomy Evolution
Version	Update Focus	Conceptual Impact
V1.2.1	Methodological Rigor & Data Enrichment	Integrated Code Complexity and Operational Metrics (Bytecode Size, Gas Used) to refine the exclusion logic and ensure scientific integrity.
V1.2.2	Advanced Analytical Protocol & Systemic Rationale	Reinforced the PI by formalizing the Boosted Aggregation Model and Marginalization for risk scoring. Validated the urgency through the Cardano Split case study.
⚙️ Technical Execution: The ADIP Pipeline
The technical architecture is the proof of concept that validates the feasibility and massive scalability of the ZOC Taxonomy. The €115,000 budget is justified by the need to execute this complex Big Data process.

Component	Role	Strategic Rationale (Execution)
Pipeline Core	High-performance, concurrent data ingestion.	Built in Go (Golang) to execute optimized Batch Inserts and manage Goroutines for rapid EVM history processing.
Data Source	Full historical data access for mass ingestion.	Alchemy Enhanced APIs are critical to process the entire EVM history archive, validating the initial taxonomy against the complete complete dataset.
Storage & Query	Analytical database for massive OLAP queries.	ClickHouse is used to host the massive dataset and provide the instantaneous query performance required for generating the ZOC Score.
Logic Layer	Complex classification, value calculation, and risk scoring.	Python (Web3.py, CoinGecko API) applies Criterion Y, the advanced V1.2.2 exclusion logic, and the Boosted Aggregation Model.
🤝 Founding Team Opportunity
We are actively recruiting founding talent to execute the MVP plan, which is structured in three clear milestones supported by a dedicated €115,000 budget.
