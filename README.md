✍️ ZOC Tracker / Z-Terminal: Dormant Echoes — Codifying the Logic of Systemic Decay 🤖
Formalize the Failure. Predict the Collapse. Clean the Pipe!

The ZOC Tracker is the first Analytical Decentralized Risk Platform (ADIP) designed to establish the Predictive Risk Standard for Chain Hygiene. We quantify the massive, unquantified accumulation of obsolete code (ZOCs) on the ledger by integrating advanced Transformer AI architecture into our analysis.

Our mission is to shift the industry from reactive auditing to Proactive Risk Management.

🧠 Core Intellectual Property & Standardization (V2.0)
The conceptual core of our work is the ZOC Taxonomy (Zombie On Chain) V2.0. The execution of the ADIP pipeline is designed solely to validate and maintain the rigor of this protocol.

The ZOC Score is now a Predictive Risk Encoding Vector.

Version	Update Focus	Conceptual Impact

V1.2.2	Advanced Analytical Protocol & Systemic Rationale	Formalized the Boosted Aggregation Model and Marginalization. Validated urgency through the Cardano Split case study.

V2.0 (New)	Transformer Architecture & Systemic Decay	MAJOR UPGRADE: Implemented the Encoder-Decoder model and Probabilistic Modeling to predict disaster occurrence. Added the Architectural Decay criterion to target eUTXO/Off-Chain complexity.

⚙️ Technical Execution: Enterprise ADIP (V2.0 Stack)
The architecture has been upgraded to a production-grade Service Architecture (MVC), designed for High Availability (HA) and Predictive Modeling. The €115,000 budget is justified by the need to execute this complex Big Data process with enterprise-level reliability.

Component	Role	Strategic Rationale (Execution)
Model/Encoder (Go)	High-performance data ingestion and Risk Vector Generation.	Built in Go (Golang) to execute optimized Batch Inserts and feed the Encoder component of the Transformer model.

Storage & Query	Analytical database for massive OLAP queries.	ClickHouse is used to host the massive dataset and provide the instantaneous query performance required for calculating the Probabilistic Score.

Logic/Decoder (ML/Stats)	Complex Predictive Modeling and Taxonomy V2.0 Application.	Python/ML applies the Probabilistic Modeling (Poisson/Exponential) and calculates the ZOC Score as a vector output.

Service Layer (API/MVC)	Latency & Availability.	Implements Caching (Redis/Memcached) and Load Balancing (HA) for low-latency API access. Secured by JWT/RBAC.
Observability (M&O)	Reliability & DRP	Defines SLOs and monitors the entire pipeline health. Confirms the use of Docker Volumes for data persistence.

🤝 Founding Team Opportunity (High-Value Recruitment)
We are actively recruiting founding talent to execute the MVP plan.
