# ✍️ ZOC Tracker / Z-Terminal: Codifying and Standardizing Chain Hygiene 🤖

**Formalize the Failure. Clean the Pipe!**

The **ZOC Tracker** is the first Analytical Data Ingestion Platform (ADIP) to **codify and standardize** the taxonomy required to measure **Digital Debris**—the massive, unquantified accumulation of obsolete code (**ZOCs**) on the EVM ledger.

Our mission is to establish the **Chain Hygiene** standard, ensuring the intellectual **paternity** of these critical new metrics and protocols.

## 🧠 Core Intellectual Property & Standardization (V1.2.1)

The conceptual core of our work is the **ZOC Taxonomy (Zombie On Chain)**, which acts as a **definitive protocol for network health**. The execution of the ADIP pipeline (Technical Architecture) is designed solely to validate and maintain the rigor of this protocol.

### Taxonomy Evolution
| Version | Update Focus | Conceptual Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **V1.2.0** | **Finalized Core Definition & ADIP Concept** | Established the **ZOC Score (0-100)** as the industry's quantifiable metric for network risk. Codified **Criterion X** (9 months inactivity) and **Criterion Y** (economic threshold < $10 USD). |
| **V1.2.1** | **Methodological Rigor & Data Enrichment** | **Reinforced Paternity** by integrating advanced metrics: **Code Complexity** (Bytecode Size, Function Count) and **Operational Metrics** (Gas Used) to refine the exclusion logic and ensure the scientific integrity of the ZOC Score. |

## ⚙️ Technical Execution: The ADIP Pipeline

The technical architecture is the **proof of concept** that validates the feasibility and massive scalability of the ZOC Taxonomy. The **€115,000 budget** is justified by the need to execute this complex Big Data process.

| Component | Role | Strategic Rationale (Execution) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pipeline Core** | High-performance, concurrent data ingestion. | Built in **Go (Golang)** to **execute** optimized **Batch Inserts** and **manage Goroutines** for rapid EVM history processing. |
| **Data Source** | Full historical data access for mass ingestion. | **Alchemy Enhanced APIs** are critical to **process** the entire EVM history archive, validating the initial taxonomy against the complete complete dataset. |
| **Storage & Query** | Analytical database for massive OLAP queries. | **ClickHouse** is used to **host** the massive dataset and provide the instantaneous query performance required for generating the ZOC Score. |
| **Logic Layer** | Complex classification, value calculation, and risk scoring. | **Python** (Web3.py, CoinGecko API) **applies** Criterion Y and the advanced V1.2.1 exclusion logic. |
